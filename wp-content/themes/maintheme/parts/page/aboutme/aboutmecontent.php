            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p class="text1">
I am an aspiring web developer based in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania.
</p>
<h2>I've been passionate about technology my entire life.</h2>

<p class="text2">
I first pursued web design during my years as a cyber-school student, 
where I initially discovered the world of web development.
During my gap year between highschool and college, I developed a strong interest in pursuing 
web development as a career. I started teaching myself through online sites like CodeAcademy, and enrolled
in HACC's Web Application & Development program. Through both school and self-teaching, I learned diverse skills involving
computer programming, database management, typography, and front-end development.
<h2>I strive to continually learn.</h2>
<p class="text3">
As the world of technology continually grows and advances, I'm consistently looking for
how I can adapt my skillset and continue to learn. A 2017 graduate from HACC, I'm eager to continue creating and 
sharing my skills with others!
</p>
<p class="text4">
<h2>I believe in a work-life balance.</h2>
I volunteer as a projectionist at my local church monthly, and assist on
stage crew for Encore! Homeschool Productions. In my free time, you can find me on the frisbee field or basketball court.
